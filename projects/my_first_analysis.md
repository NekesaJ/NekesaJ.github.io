# Analyzing Movie Ratings

I found a dataset of movies online and asked: **"Do longer movies have higher ratings?"**

## Here's what I did:
1.  I used **Python** and the **pandas** library to load the data.
2.  I cleaned the data by removing missing values.
3.  I made a scatter plot with **matplotlib**.

## Here's what I found:
There was no strong link between movie length and ratings!
