# Hi there! 👋 I'm Jael
## This is my Data Science Portfolio

### My Skills

I leverage a full-stack data toolkit—from wrangling raw data with Python to building interactive dashboards in Tableau—to find stories, patterns, and actionable insights.

**Programming & Databases:**
- **Python** (Core language for analysis and automation)
- **SQL** (For querying and managing relational databases)
- **Git & GitHub** (For version control and project collaboration)

**Data Analysis & Manipulation:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (For efficient data manipulation and numerical computing)
- **Statistical Analysis**

**Data Visualization & Communication:**
- **Tableau** (Building interactive dashboards and reports)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Creating static and statistical visualizations in Python)
- **Storytelling with Data** (Communicating insights clearly to stakeholders)

**Machine Learning:**
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** (Building, training, and evaluating predictive models)
- **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Feature Engineering**

**Tools & Platforms:**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (For iterative analysis, prototyping, and documentation)
- **Google Colab** (For cloud-based notebook development)
